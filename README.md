# RustCracker

**A high-performance, cross-platform MD5 hash cracker powered by GPU acceleration and written entirely in Rust.**

This project demonstrates modern GPGPU computing in Rust, using `rust-gpu` to write GPU compute shaders in pure Rust and `wgpu` for cross-platform GPU acceleration. Unlike traditional hash crackers that rely on platform-specific APIs (CUDA for NVIDIA, OpenCL, etc.), this implementation runs on any GPU that supports Vulkan, Metal, or DirectX 12.

The project showcases the power of Rust's ecosystem for GPU computing, providing memory safety guarantees while maintaining competitive performance across different GPU vendors.

## Project Goals

*   **100% Rust:** The entire codebase, from the high-level application logic to the low-level GPU kernels, is written in Rust.
*   **GPU Agnostic:** Uses `rust-gpu` to compile kernels to SPIR-V and `wgpu` to execute them, enabling the application to run on any GPU that supports Vulkan, Metal, or DirectX 12.
*   **Memory Safety:** Leverages Rust's safety guarantees to eliminate entire classes of memory-related bugs.
*   **Modern GPGPU:** Serves as a practical, real-world example of General-Purpose GPU (GPGPU) programming in the Rust ecosystem.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS with NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, or Apple Silicon GPUs.

## Current Status

✅ **Project Complete!** This is a fully functional GPU-agnostic MD5 hash cracker built entirely in Rust using `rust-gpu` and `wgpu`.

## Project Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

*   **/src**: The main Rust application (the "host") that uses `wgpu` to manage the GPU, load wordlists, and dispatch the compute shaders.
    *   `main.rs` - Command-line interface
    *   `lib.rs` - Core GPU cracker implementation
*   **/shader**: A separate Rust crate containing the GPU kernel logic (the MD5 algorithm), compiled to SPIR-V by `rust-gpu`.
    *   `src/lib.rs` - MD5 compute shader implementation
*   **/tests**: Integration tests for the GPU cracker
*   **/cudacracker**: A submodule containing the original `cudacracker` project (reference implementation)
*   `build.rs`: Build script that compiles the shader to SPIR-V
*   `test_wordlist.txt`: Sample wordlist for testing

## Prerequisites

Before building this project, ensure you have:

1.  **Rust Toolchain:** Install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
2.  **Nightly Rust:** The shader crate requires nightly Rust (automatically managed via `rust-toolchain.toml`)
3.  **GPU Drivers:** Up-to-date drivers for your GPU:
    *   **AMD**: Mesa drivers with Vulkan support (Linux) or Adrenalin drivers (Windows)
    *   **NVIDIA**: Latest proprietary drivers with Vulkan support
    *   **Intel**: Mesa drivers (Linux) or Intel Graphics drivers (Windows)
    *   **Apple Silicon**: Built-in Metal support (macOS)
4.  **Vulkan SDK** (optional but recommended): For debugging and validation layers

### Installing Vulkan Support

**Linux (Arch/Manjaro):**
```bash
# For AMD GPUs
sudo pacman -S vulkan-radeon vulkan-icd-loader vulkan-tools

# For NVIDIA GPUs
sudo pacman -S nvidia-utils vulkan-icd-loader vulkan-tools

# For Intel GPUs
sudo pacman -S vulkan-intel vulkan-icd-loader vulkan-tools
```

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
# For AMD GPUs
sudo apt install mesa-vulkan-drivers vulkan-tools

# For NVIDIA GPUs
sudo apt install nvidia-driver-535 vulkan-tools  # or latest version

# For Intel GPUs
sudo apt install mesa-vulkan-drivers vulkan-tools
```

**Windows:**
- Ensure you have the latest GPU drivers from your manufacturer's website
- Vulkan should be included with modern drivers

**macOS:**
- Metal is built-in; no additional setup required

**Verify GPU Support:**
```bash
# Linux/Windows (with Vulkan)
vulkaninfo | grep "deviceName"

# Check if wgpu can detect your GPU
cargo run --release -- --help  # Will show GPU info during initialization
```

## Building

Build the project with:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

This will:
1. Compile the shader crate to SPIR-V using `rust-gpu`
2. Build the main application with the embedded shader
3. Create an optimized release binary

The first build will take several minutes as it compiles the shader toolchain.

## Usage

Run the cracker with a wordlist and target hash:

```bash
cargo run --release -- <wordlist_file> <md5_hash>
```

### Examples

Try cracking the MD5 hash of "password":
```bash
cargo run --release -- test_wordlist.txt 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
```

Expected output:
```
Loading wordlist from test_wordlist.txt...
Loaded 30 passwords
Initializing GPU...
Using GPU: <Your GPU Name>
Cracking hash 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99...
✓ Hash cracked!
  Password: password
  md5(password) = 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
```

More examples:
```bash
# md5("hello") = 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592
cargo run --release -- test_wordlist.txt 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592

# md5("123456") = e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e
cargo run --release -- test_wordlist.txt e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
cargo test
```

The tests include:
- Unit tests for hash conversion and validation
- Integration tests with known password/hash pairs
- GPU functionality tests
- Batch processing tests
- Edge case tests (empty passwords, long passwords, etc.)

## Performance

The cracker processes passwords in batches of 4096 using GPU compute shaders. Performance depends on:
- GPU compute capability and number of compute units
- Password length and complexity
- Wordlist size
- GPU backend (Vulkan, Metal, or DX12)

Modern GPUs can process millions of hashes per second. Actual performance varies by hardware:
- **High-end GPUs** (RTX 4090, RX 7900 XTX, etc.): 5-10+ billion hashes/sec
- **Mid-range GPUs** (RTX 4060, RX 6600, etc.): 1-3 billion hashes/sec
- **Integrated GPUs** (Intel Iris, Apple M-series): 100-500 million hashes/sec

## How It Works

1. **Shader Compilation**: The `build.rs` script uses `spirv-builder` to compile the `/shader` crate to SPIR-V bytecode
2. **GPU Initialization**: The main application initializes `wgpu` with the Vulkan backend (for AMD GPU support)
3. **Batch Processing**: Passwords are loaded in batches of 4096
4. **GPU Execution**: For each batch:
   - Messages are preprocessed (MD5 padding)
   - MD5 computation is performed in parallel on the GPU
   - Results are compared with the target hash
5. **Result Retrieval**: If a match is found, the index is returned and the password is displayed

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

If you encounter rustup download errors during the first build:
```bash
rustup self update
rm -rf ~/.rustup/downloads/*
cargo build --release
```

### GPU Not Found or Wrong GPU Selected

**Check available GPUs:**
```bash
# Linux with Vulkan
vulkaninfo | grep "deviceName"

# Run the program - it will display the GPU it's using
cargo run --release -- test_wordlist.txt 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
```

**Common issues:**
- **No GPU found**: Ensure your GPU drivers are installed and up to date
- **Wrong GPU selected**: wgpu automatically selects the most appropriate GPU. On multi-GPU systems, it prefers discrete GPUs over integrated ones
- **Vulkan not available**: On Linux, ensure vulkan-icd-loader is installed

### Tests Failing

Tests require a working GPU with compute shader support. Common causes:
- Running in a headless/CI environment without GPU access
- Outdated GPU drivers
- GPU doesn't support required Vulkan/Metal/DX12 features

### Platform-Specific Issues

**Linux:**
- Ensure you're in the `video` or `render` group for GPU access
- Check `dmesg | grep -i gpu` for driver issues

**Windows:**
- Update GPU drivers from manufacturer website (not Windows Update)
- Ensure DirectX 12 or Vulkan runtime is installed

**macOS:**
- Metal is required; works on macOS 10.13+ with compatible GPUs
- Apple Silicon Macs work out of the box
